Portfolio+Q&amp;As

- As per url: https://imgur.com/a/GzT7xhW
- Images just cut from a screenshot
- kinda responsive down to about 1150px width
- there are inset borders in the images on cards that could be made by css border property, since they are in the cut out I didn't bother
- I can play and fiddle with it further... e.g. few tweaks for 100% responsivnes, hover/fade/animation effects
- There is some kind of a very hard to see border around some objects, didn't bother with it so far as well
